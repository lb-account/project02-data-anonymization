# Differential Privacy: A Study on Privacy-Preserving Techniques  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explores differential privacy (DP) and related privacy-preserving techniques in data analysis and machine learning. It covers key concepts such as k-anonymity, additive noise DP mechanisms, and training a deep learning model using the PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles) framework

## ðŸ“‚ Contents  
- **k-Anonymity** â€“ A traditional approach to anonymization and its weaknesses  
- **Differential Privacy** â€“ Theoretical foundation, sensitivity, the Laplace mechanism and the Gaussian mechanism
- **PATE Framework** â€“ A privacy-preserving approach using teacher-student models  

## ðŸ“š Libraries  
This project uses the following Python libraries:  

- **pandas** â€“ Data handling and manipulation  
- **numpy** â€“ Numerical computing  
- **matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning models, dataset splitting, shuffling, and evaluation metrics
